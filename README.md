## About dataset
A1_Score to A10_Score - These columns represent scores from the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ-10) screening tool, which is a standardized 10-item questionnaire used to assess traits associated with autism [Allison et al., 2012]. Each item contributes 1 point based on specific responses. A total score of 6 or higher suggests the individual may benefit from a specialist diagnostic assessment.

4	If there is an interruption, I can switch back to what I was doing very quickly
5	I find it easy to ‘read between the lines’ when someone is talking to me
